These are other resources on power analysis by simulation:

* [SuperpowerBook](https://aaroncaldwell.us/SuperpowerBook/) by Aaron R. Caldwell, DaniÃ«l Lakens, Chelsea M. Parlett-Pelleriti, Guy Prochilo, and Frederik Aust. *This teaches how to use the superpower R package to simulate factorial designs and calculate power.*
* Blog post series "[Power Analysis by Data Simulation in R](https://julianquandt.com/post/power-analysis-by-data-simulation-in-r-part-i/)" by Julian Quandt (see Parts I to IV). *These blog posts provide a very detailed step-by-step explanation of the necessary steps.*
* "Simulation-based power analysis for regression" by Andrew Hales ([Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2hhc5KYw-c), [OSF Material](https://osf.io/e42mg/)). *In this video, Andrew explains the steps to you.*
* [`faux`](https://debruine.github.io/faux/index.html) package by Lisa DeBruine. *Simulate data for factorial and mixed designs.*
